Project Introduction
===================
This project is inspired by going to restaurants where they are very busy and don’t have enough waiters to serve every table which makes the efficiency low. Having a website that can allow people to view menus and order through the website can increase the restaurants’ efficiency and reduce the cost of manpower. Also, it would be very easy to manage the restaurant even on your phone. Updating menus becomes very easy and free. 
This website will be very helpful for every restaurant owner who is experiencing difficulty in managing orders, seeking better efficiency, saving costs, or loves exploring new menus.
RestaurantMan is a website designed for restaurant management where, Customers can register a user account to place orders in-store or pick up. Restaurant owners can register and manage orders and tables, while storing all the data in the cloud for further analysis. This would be marketed as a SaaS (Software as a Service) program for brick and mortar restaurants looking for a more personalized in-house experience for its customers.
