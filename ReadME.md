RestaurantMan Backend API
=========================

My contributions: I was in charge of making the backend api. I designed a mySQL database to hold all app data, with AWS S3 for image hosting. I created a node.js api server using express.js. I also handled user authentication and authorization through JWT tokens. Set up AWS environment for these services: S3, EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, Elastic Load Balancer, CloudFront, AWS RDS, R53, IAM, CloudFormation, CodeStar.

Project Introduction
===================

RestaurantMan is a website designed for restaurant management where customers can register a user account to place orders for in-store or pick up. Restaurant owners can register and manage orders and tables, while storing all the data in the cloud for further analysis. This would be marketed as a SaaS (Software as a Service) program for brick and mortar restaurants looking for a more personalized in-house experience for its customers.
